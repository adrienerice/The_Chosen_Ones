The standup was yesterday and there was some interesting and useful feedback. 

1. Ben Matthews made the point that if he didn't want to interrupt someone with an instant message he would send an email.

This is useful because it's helped solve one of my issues from the start: who is the #target-audience? Because I personally just stick to the same messaging service, I hadn't considered this as a possiblity for fixing the issue. 

Clearly, I need to focus on this aspect in my interviews.
