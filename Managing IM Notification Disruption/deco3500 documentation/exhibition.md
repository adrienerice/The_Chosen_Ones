## The Problem
Mobile Instant Messaging is a misleading name. Your message may well turn up on someone's phone instantly, but you don't know when they're going to read it. Sometimes you have to wait hours for a reply and sometimes you start a conversation that feels like it might as well be over the phone. 

Instant Messaging Apps are in the grey area between synchronous and asynchoronous communication. They can be immediate, conversational with rapid-fire responses, like a phone call, or they can be ponderous and slow-moving like emails. 

Sometimes, it isn't clear through a message whether someone wants to start a conversation or is perhaps simply requesting information. There are none of the usual social cues. 

I tried to solve this problem by making it clear when an instant message is supposed to be the start of a conversation and when it isn't.
