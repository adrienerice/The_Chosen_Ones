### The Requirements:
todo
## v0 - based on Chat App
A basic chat  app, for this project, needs to facilitate 
- sending messages to 1 person
- displaying messages and message history
- adding contacts
- blocking unwanted contacts
- making notifications when receiving a message



# Requirement Elicitation
## User Interviews
### Aims
understand current behaviours of IM vs IRL
- what are the current social conventions for IM? Do they differ from face-to-face?
- how does inferring a contact's availability change user behaviour?
- how does having the option to indicate availability affect users? (social pressures?)

### Results
#### Transcripts
#### Affinity Diagrams/Interview Insights


The issue with the individual statuses comes about when trying to expand to more than just 1 person. This is another design issue for the future. Some examples include:
having a screen specifically for viewing which statuses are set for who, having a limit on the number of settable statuses. Allowing statuses to be set 1-to-1 only.




- 		(At 12:04pm, John said he was 'Busy')
		(Or approximate: Within the last hour, John said he is 'Busy')
						 More than 3 hours ago, John said he was 'Busy')
		(OR start with specific, and then get more approximate::::)
		and then allow people to choose how long the time remains specific
						John said he is 'Busy' 20 minutes ago
						---- 30 min mark reached --- 
						John said he was 'Busy' within the last hour
						John said he was 'Busy' more than 1 hour ago
		ALSO for short periods of time, make it blurrier:
					John: 'Busy', within the last 5 minutes
						
    - then user controlled notification options (sound, sight)


Trying to resolve the synchronous/asynchronous ambiguity of Instant Messaging. 
Helping users to answer the question: "Is the other person willing and able to have a synchronous conversation?""
Meeting the user need "I don't want the other person to think I am willing and able to have a synchronous conversation when I am not"
Availability indicators and notifications need to reflect this willingness and capability (or not) to have a synchronous conversation.
Thus, the question "Is now good?"
And the replies, Yes, No, Sorta.
And the option for "Now is not good for me" but more implicit than that.

Hey, is now good?
phone: they said they were busy half an hour ago, would you like to ask them anyway?
Yes.
them: I am still busy.
