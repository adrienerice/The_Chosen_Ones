# Requirement Elicitation
## User Interviews
### Aims
understand current behaviours of IM vs IRL
- what are the current social conventions for IM? Do they differ from face-to-face?
- how does inferring a contact's availability change user behaviour?
- how does having the option to indicate availability affect users? (social pressures?)
