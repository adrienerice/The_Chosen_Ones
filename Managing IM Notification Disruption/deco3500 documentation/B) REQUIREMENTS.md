### The Requirements:
todo
## v0 - based on Chat App
A basic chat  app, for this project, needs to facilitate 
- sending messages to 1 person
- displaying messages and message history
- adding contacts
- blocking unwanted contacts
- making notifications when receiving a message



# Requirement Elicitation
## User Interviews
### Aims
understand current behaviours of IM vs IRL
- what are the current social conventions for IM? Do they differ from face-to-face?
- how does inferring a contact's availability change user behaviour?
- how does having the option to indicate availability affect users? (social pressures?)

### Results
#### Transcripts
#### Affinity Diagrams/Interview Insights


The issue with the individual statuses comes about when trying to expand to more than just 1 person. This is another design issue for the future. Some examples include:
having a screen specifically for viewing which statuses are set for who, having a limit on the number of settable statuses. Allowing statuses to be set 1-to-1 only.




- 		(At 12:04pm, John said he was 'Busy')
		(Or approximate: Within the last hour, John said he is 'Busy')
						 More than 3 hours ago, John said he was 'Busy')
		(OR start with specific, and then get more approximate::::)
		and then allow people to choose how long the time remains specific
						John said he is 'Busy' 20 minutes ago
						---- 30 min mark reached --- 
						John said he was 'Busy' within the last hour
						John said he was 'Busy' more than 1 hour ago
		ALSO for short periods of time, make it blurrier:
					John: 'Busy', within the last 5 minutes
						
    - then user controlled notification options (sound, sight)
