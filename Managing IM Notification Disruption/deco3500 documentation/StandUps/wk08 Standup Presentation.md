I'm looking at improving availability indicators so that notifications can be socially mediated.

I'm basing my work on MyButler which has sender-controlled notifications and private, reactive status sharing. (where the status is shared only to one person and only when that person sends you a message). 

That app was peripheral to KakaoTalk (an IM app in South Korea), it acted like a notification czar. I was going to do this too but realised the 'last online' and read reciepts will affect the results. 

I also am not confident in my skills to make an app. So I have spent my time making sure I can actually get a chat app to work. This has taken up most of my time and I'm pretty much there. 

I am confident that I can get interviews done (because I have several people who are willing and questions already written) and gather requirements, and generate and test designs within the next three weeks. 



- describe findings from user research (interviews etc.)
- describe clear set of requirements
- generated designs 
	- (as well as non-functional prototype(s))
