# interview 3

[00:00:00] **Luke:** Um, all right. So I have to do the ethics thing first before I start the proper interview. But, um, I just have to let you know the purpose of the interview, which is I'm researching about, um, like notifications on the mobile phone in terms of messages from other people. 

[00:00:26] **Participant 3:** Yeah, 

[00:00:27] **Luke:** how disruptive they can be. Um, and just how conversation is on- through like text messaging on the phone.

[00:00:44] And you can withdraw at any time. You're under no obligation to continue. You don't have to answer any questions you don't want to. I'll protect your identity, reputation, and data. I'll de-identify the data and delete anything you want and won't use it to make you look bad. I'll delete audio recordings and just keep transcriptions.

[00:01:03] Are you okay with me recording the audio of this interview?

[00:01:07] **Participant 3:** I [Participant 3's full name] acknowledge these terms.

[00:01:10] **Luke:** Thank you. Excellent. I think you're the most formal person who's done it so far, others have just been like, yeah, no worries. 

[00:01:20] **Participant 3:** I'm just joking.

[00:01:23] **Luke:** I know, but it's, it looks good on the transcript.

[00:01:28] Although, I am going to have to take your name out.

[00:01:35] &quot;I, participant 3...&quot; 

[00:01:38] **Participant 3:** Yeah, to protect my reputation haha.

[00:01:41] **Luke:** Okay. So I guess how much do you instant message? Is it like how regularly, I guess? Is it a very frequent thing? 

[00:01:49] **Participant 3:** Very frequent. 

[00:01:52] So I have, I have WhatsApp, which I have with a lot of people, I use Facebook Messenger to message a lot of people, and I also have slack at work. 

[00:02:09] **Luke:** Ok, slack at work, ok cool, 

[00:02:10] Um, and so that was going to be my next question, which ones do you use, which is good. Um, and I guess you've been, how long have you been doing it for uhh, messaging using these services for.

[00:02:25] Instant messaging in general and it doesn't have to be exact can just be rough.

[00:02:32] **Participant 3:** Umm, 

[00:02:35] **Luke:** 15 years 

[00:02:40] and are there any that you used to use, but you no longer do 

[00:02:47] **Participant 3:** SMS messages, 

[00:02:48] **Luke:** SMS. Cool. How come you don't use the SMS anymore? 

[00:02:55] **Participant 3:** Um, it's not backed up to the cloud, I don't know, the app is bad.

[00:03:07] Um,

[00:03:19] I don't like that it's tied- I don't know,

[00:03:27] I mainly don't like that it's not backed up to the cloud.

[00:03:37] I like being disconnected from the physical device. I like being able to use my instant messaging on my PC as well.

[00:03:51] **Luke:** 

[00:03:51] Yeah.

[00:03:51] You said the app is bad. Is there any reason? 

[00:04:00] **Participant 3:** Um,

[00:04:06] Maybe it's not so bad. It's just, it feels old school.

[00:04:14] **Luke:** Cool.

[00:04:17] So on WhatsApp and Facebook messenger and slack, there's um, different ways of finding out how available someone is. So, um, I guess the first question is, do you use those, uh, availability indicators? 

[00:04:38] **Participant 3:** I do definitely for slack. Not for Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp.,

[00:04:48] **Luke:** I then for slack. Which ones do you use?

[00:04:54] **Participant 3:** Indicator? 

[00:04:55] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:04:56] **Participant 3:** Just whether they're online or not. 

[00:04:58] **Luke:** Okay. Yeah. Like the status then? 

[00:05:00] **Participant 3:** Yeah, status. 

[00:05:01] **Luke:** Um,. 

[00:05:02] **Participant 3:** Sometimes it's good if they're away for lunch or if they're in a meeting or something.

[00:05:08] **Luke:** Yeah. Cool. Um, so when you see those, um, you know, if they're in a meeting or they're away for lunch, does that change what messages you'll send them? 

[00:05:20] **Participant 3:** Yes. I'll only send them a message when I don't need an answer straight away. 

[00:05:27] **Luke:** If you don't need an answer straight away ?

[00:05:29] **Participant 3:** Oh well, if they're in a meeting I won't message them.

[00:05:33] **Luke:** In a meeting, but if they're- 

[00:05:36] **Participant 3:** [internet cuts out] there are random questions that I want an immediate response to,

[00:05:42] **Luke:** um, yeah, I think that broke up a bit, but, well, I think I got that. If they're at lunch, you'll send them a message that you don't need an immediate response to is that right? 

[00:05:53] **Participant 3:** Yeah. 

[00:05:54] **Luke:** Cool. Um, okay, so you don't use the activity indicators on WhatsApp or Facebook messenger. Um, sois there-, 

[00:06:08] **Participant 3:** Facebook- with Facebook messenger it's just whether they're online or not, isn't it? 

[00:06:14] **Luke:** Um, yeah. There's well, yeah, it has the, it does say if they're online, if they're active now, Um, but it also says the last time they were active, um, you use that at all? 

[00:06:30] **Participant 3:** No. 

[00:06:31] **Luke:** No. And if they're online now, does that change it at all? 

[00:06:35] **Participant 3:** Not 

[00:06:38] That I expect them to receive it straight away.

[00:06:39] Anyway, 

[00:06:41] **Luke:** you you, so you, what you don't expect? 

[00:06:44] **Participant 3:** I expect them to receive it on their phones straight away, I don't usually expect them to respond straight away, but... 

[00:06:51] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, and I guess part of that then is those read receipts. Um, do you use those at all? 

[00:07:03] **Participant 3:** I do, yeah, definitely. 

[00:07:04] **Luke:** Yeah, so, um, I think there's the three different little icons. There's the first one is that it's been sent, but it hasn't been delivered to their phone.

[00:07:21] And the second one is it's been delivered to their phone. And the third one is that they've read it. 

[00:07:27] **Participant 3:** Yes. 

[00:07:28] **Luke:** Um, 

[00:07:31] so I guess, um,

[00:07:41] How does that, is that information useful? 

[00:07:46] **Participant 3:** Yeah, not the 'sent' ones not that useful. I mean, generally I have reception everywhere so I don't really, I don't really use that much. Um, the 'received' one, that's not that useful because generally everyone has rec-, oh, I use that sometimes that way I'll know if [Wife's] phone batteries died. 

[00:08:12] **Luke:** Ah yep, ok, that's good to know.

[00:08:14] **Participant 3:** And then if they read it or not, it's very useful.because you know whether they received your message,

[00:08:23] **Luke:** um, and also on facebook messenger. I, well, I guess that's on WhatsApp as well. Isn't it? Those read receipts. 

[00:08:33] **Participant 3:** Yep. Same on, uh, actually Facebook messenger, 

[00:08:38] Does facebook have whether they'd received it or not? It has whether they've read it.

[00:08:48] **Luke:** It has the circle, and the tick, if the tick's coloured in, that's right. Oh yeah.

[00:08:55] Um, 

[00:08:58] **Participant 3:** Slack doesn't have that though 

[00:09:06] **Luke:** Slack doesn't have, have 

[00:09:07] **Participant 3:** that, ok. 

[00:09:08] It doesn't have read receipts, it doesn't have.. it doesn't have any of that. 

[00:09:14] **Luke:** Um, so I guess the, is it, would you prefer that I did,

[00:09:22] **Participant 3:** uh... Some... in some cases I would.

[00:09:31] But I think it fits better with slack as a, a more work oriented tool, . 

[00:09:41] **Luke:** Okay, why's that? 

[00:09:46] **Participant 3:** Um, it's just maybe like too intrusive, like, you know, you're happy with you. Happy to have someone, like giving someone acknowledgement that they've read their message and that sort of stuff. If they're personal, like if they're a personal friend, but that feels like that's a bit too much, like it's too intrusive on like a professional app where might not necessarily.

[00:10:13] you know, like get along with them or you might need some time to think about, respond to what they've

[00:10:23] put the pressure on you. If you, if you feel like that they can see when you've messaged.

[00:10:30] Like it put's social pressure on you,

[00:10:40] **Luke:** um, ok, so,that that pressure is, um, that pressure isn't present in, uh, like if you had messaging, personal friends, 

[00:10:54] **Participant 3:** uh, definitely less so.

[00:11:00] Yeah. It's, uh, it's just like, it's also that, like, you know them and in the end, you're friends with them. So. I feel like it's not going to be misconstrued as you being rude because I feel like they know me well enough to know

[00:11:28] or whatever. Whereas if it's someone you just slack with instant message. There's more room to misinterpret, like the tone of messages, that sort of stuff. If you don't actually know the person. 

[00:11:50] **Luke:** Yeah. So, um, that's yeah, that's an interesting one. Um, so with these people that you instant message through work, are they people that you speak to face to face very much.

[00:12:10] **Participant 3:** Yeah, 

[00:12:11] **Luke:** it was, um, so, but it's, it's more than, it's not, it's not the amount of communication that you've had with them. It's like face to face, like, does that, I was basically wondering if, if you talk to them more face to face, does that help or is it just the professional versus personal relationship? 

[00:12:32] **Participant 3:** Does what help?

[00:12:34] **Luke:** Um, in terms of alleviating that pressure to respond.

[00:12:41] **Participant 3:** Oh,

[00:12:46] **Luke:** Sorry, say that again. 

[00:12:51] **Participant 3:** Like if you're messaging them and then also talking face to face about the same topic. 

[00:12:56] **Luke:** Yeah, yeah. Like this, um, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

[00:13:02] **Participant 3:** Yeah, but like, for instance, like I'll work from home, for like a few days in a row.

[00:13:10] It's not like I'm messaging them across the room, so, 

[00:13:13] **Luke:** yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, uh, would you message across the room? 

[00:13:19] **Participant 3:** Uh, yeah. Sometimes if it's like, if it's something that I sort of want a record of as well.

[00:13:31] And reference back to later, like if I'm asking them a question that's highly technical, I want reference back to it later.I want to have it recorded.Um,

[00:14:01] **Luke:** in the work setting, are there people who, um, you're more comfortable with who you wouldn't mind having those read receipts? 

[00:14:12] **Participant 3:** Yes. 

[00:14:15] **Luke:** Um, so w would it be beneficial then to be able to control on an individual basis? Who has those read receipts,

[00:14:27] **Participant 3:** Possibly. But then like if you're turning it on for some people and other people like...Then that sort of becomes [ ... ] itself

[00:14:40] yeah. Like people would be aware of whether you're allowing that for them or not. 

[00:14:51] **Luke:** So then it becomes another area for social pressure, I guess? 

[00:14:58] **Participant 3:** Yeah.

[00:15:01] **Luke:** With the WhatsApp and the Facebook message. they have read receipts, but they also have messaged previews

[00:15:13] so you can get at least the first couple of lines of the message from the notification without having actually read the notification or completed the read receipt. 

[00:15:28] **Participant 3:** I do like that. I do use that. 

[00:15:32] **Luke:** Why do you like that? 

[00:15:34] **Participant 3:** If I'm not ready to respond to someone immediately.

[00:15:39] You don't want to give the indication sometimes that you've read it and not responded. I can get what the message it about and decide that it's not important . Like if I'm in a meeting or something [inaudible] important things. Also. You can also see like most of the messages it's like, if you like expand that you can get more. 

[00:16:04] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. So, uh, is there, has there ever been a point where you tried to expand it and it hasn't given you all of the message I guess, or is that 

[00:16:18] **Participant 3:** all the message? 

[00:16:20] **Luke:** Well, I dunno. I don't know if there's a limit on that.

[00:16:22] Does it, does it still limit it when you expand? 

[00:16:25] **Participant 3:** There is a limit might be like six or seven lines.

[00:16:33] **Luke:** So that that's usually enough to figure out the content of the message. 

[00:16:39] **Participant 3:** Yeah, definitely.

[00:16:41] **Luke:** Yeah. Cool. 

[00:16:42] Um, so, um, a lot of it, I guess, has been about you think other people, um, like the availability of other people, but do you think. Well, I guess, I guess that's part of it is that you don't want to show them the read receipt on your end from their message.

[00:17:09] So you'll just use the message. Um, preview, I guess, is, is that, so there's the two aspects of it. There's the read receipt and there's the, like active now in the last online thing. Does either of those ever come to your mind when you're previewing that message or, um, opening, maybe you're opening a messaging app.

[00:17:39] And you might think about whether it's showing you is active now or not. Does that come into your mind at all? 

[00:17:49] **Participant 3:** Yeah. Someone else.

[00:17:54] So Casey, semi dizzy, like sometimes just preview the message to Atlanta.

[00:18:07] **Luke:** Okay. So that raid receipt is the main one. You don't think about other people using the, um, act like the other activity indicator, which is the like active now or the, 

[00:18:19] **Participant 3:** yeah, I don't really consider that. 

[00:18:23] **Luke:** And I'm also on WhatsApp and Facebook messenger, and I'm not sure if it's on slack, they have the, the little message bubble pop up when you're typing.

[00:18:37] **Participant 3:** Ah, yeah. 

[00:18:39] **Luke:** Um. 

[00:18:39] **Participant 3:** They have that on slack too. 

[00:18:42] **Luke:** Okay. Um, Does that, uh, how, how did, how do you relate to that when other people are sending you a message and you see that they're typing. 

[00:18:56] **Participant 3:** Yeah. I like, I liked that because I know that someone [inaudible]

[00:19:02] Because I always have the phone on silent, sometimes I miss, when people are sending me messages, I can know that like I've sent a message that someone's responding, like I can wait for it, expect it.

[00:19:16] **Luke:** And I guess part of that then is do they ever stop typing and not send you a message? 

[00:19:27] **Participant 3:** Not really, no.

[00:19:28] **Luke:** Okay, cool. Um, and that's the slack one. Is that mainly on slack or is that also.

[00:19:48] Um, so that's mostly about the availability indicator of this stuff, um, the other one is more about receiving notifications at' bad times or. Yeah. Basically being interrupted by notifications. Um, can you think of any examples of that happening to you or is it, do you have any, 

[00:20:21] **Participant 3:** yeah, like there is like a somewhat sort of subconscious need to like read something that's been sent to you straightaway. So I find it difficult to like ignore a message.

[00:20:45] **Luke:** Sorry did you say just to read the message. 

[00:20:50] **Participant 3:** Yeah, to read it. Yeah. I just feel like I need to read what's [inaudible].

[00:20:58] **Luke:** And it makes it,

[00:21:03] sir.

[00:21:53] **Participant 3:** Sorry. 

[00:21:55] **Luke:** Yep. Okay.

[00:22:00] Maybe it dropped out. Um, um, I can stop my video through that'll help with the connection.

[00:22:13] Uh, I didn't, I was just saying I'll stop the video. So it'll help with the internet. Um, yeah. So you feel that pressure to rate the message, but, um, is there a pressure to respond to it as well? 

[00:22:30] **Participant 3:** Um, depends what the message is. 

[00:22:36] **Luke:** Yeah. Um,

[00:22:41] So are there does it in terms of it, depending on what the message is-. 

[00:22:48] **Participant 3:** Depends on what the message is, but who the person is as well.

[00:22:56] I've got friends that I'll organise to play board games with and whatever, and like

[00:23:01] you can just organize this throughout the day. It's not like an urgent thing you need to respond to.

[00:23:17] If [Wife] is asking me questions I'll generally be responding to them faster.

[00:23:27] If [Wife] is asking me questions I'll be respond to the more promptly and if I'm being asked, work questions then I'll yeah, feel pressure to respond to that so that, yeah,it doesn't look like I'm not working

[00:23:45] um, 

[00:23:48] **Luke:** sorry, can you say that again? it dropped out. You said something about responding. It looks, it looks like you're not working.

[00:24:01] [ inaudible] 

[00:24:01] Okay. 

[00:24:04] So the, you respond to the work messages quicker, you feel the pressure to review and, um, what was the about the message to [wife]? Sorry.

[00:24:24] Okay. Um, Cool. I think that's, I think that's everything then. Cause, uh, unless there's anything else that you want to say about like just instant messaging and I don't know if it's does it, how does instant messaging feel in general? Is it like.

[00:24:39] **Participant 3:** I really like instant messaging. I don't like talking to people on the phone so much. I'll often use the chat for support questions to companies rather than calling them, cause it's more convenient

[00:24:59] like if you're waiting on the phone, it's annoying. But if you just have a chat off to the side of your screen which you're waiting on, it's much less annoying.

[00:25:10] So I use that aspect of it's [indauble - transcript?] as well 

[00:25:13] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. So you don't have to be as present? 

[00:25:18] **Participant 3:** Yes. It's a lot more instantaneous than sending emails back and forwards. 

[00:25:25] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. 

[00:25:27] **Participant 3:** Yeah. 

[00:25:30] **Luke:** So it's a lot more instantaneous and sending emails because, uh, 

[00:25:34] **Participant 3:** because you can have a lot more back and forth. 

[00:25:37] **Luke:** Okay. Like you could send an email back and forth like a chat but..

[00:25:44] **Participant 3:** But sometimes you can, but generally companies will respond to you faster in an instant message than an email. 

[00:25:54] **Luke:** Okay. 

[00:25:55] And do you email, other people, um,

[00:26:02] is it just companies or do you email other people as well?

[00:26:08] Um, 

[00:26:12] **Participant 3:** No, it's just companies. 

[00:26:15] **Luke:** Okay, cool. And that's because you want that that, um, it's more responsive or, 

[00:26:27] **Participant 3:** yeah, so, um, and it's easier because 

[00:26:32] **Luke:** easier? 

[00:26:33] **Participant 3:** You don't always have access to someone's personal email, but if you've got their phone number or on Facebook or WhatsApp like it's just a bigger contact list. 

[00:26:46] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. And, um,

[00:26:49] you were also saying it'snot the same, sending an email as it is just sending a message. 

[00:26:58] **Participant 3:** Yeah. And email feels more formal.

[00:27:02] **Luke:** Um, and so that means that you have to do what differently?

[00:27:14] **Participant 3:** Uh, I dunno, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like I don't know it just, you get the feeling an email takes longer to get through to someone. Not everyone has notifications on their phone when they receive an email. 

[00:27:30] **Luke:** Okay. 

[00:27:31] **Participant 3:** Like they do for messaging. 

[00:27:34] **Luke:** Yeah, 

[00:27:34] **Participant 3:** and I feel like there's a lot higher chance people changing their emails.

[00:27:43] **Luke:** So ok, so it's harder to get hold of them. 

[00:27:45] **Participant 3:** Like [Friend] for instance, he's got like three or four different emails. I can never remember which one he actually uses. Same with you, [my old, unprofessional email address]. Like I have no idea what email you use. 

[00:28:00] **Luke:** I have. I've got them all forwarded to the same email address. So I'll just use, 

[00:28:07] **Participant 3:** There's no, you know, there's no, 

[00:28:10] **Luke:** yeah. It's not clear. 

[00:28:12] **Participant 3:** Yeah. 

[00:28:13] **Luke:** Yeah. Fair enough. 

[00:28:14] **Participant 3:** It's not clear when you're sending it whether they're actually going to receive it or not, or whether they have received it. 

[00:28:19] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yep. So it's not clear for that.

[00:28:26] So how would it be if there were read receipts on emails? 

[00:28:31] **Participant 3:** Um, you know there actually is? 

[00:28:34] **Luke:** There is? Okay.

[00:28:37] **Participant 3:** Um, the people like the salespeople and stuff at work, they use this thing called HubSpot and send emails. And it'll tell you if someone's opened the email, how many times they've opened it. 

[00:28:51] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:28:52] **Participant 3:** I think how long they've opened- maybe not, but yeah, it would just show whether they've, you know, down to the level of if they've opened how many times.

[00:29:02] So there's definitely that functionality available. 

[00:29:06] **Luke:** Is that, um, like a third party thing or is that built in. 

[00:29:10] **Participant 3:** I'm not sure to be honest. 

[00:29:12] **Luke:** Yeah. And certainly not very obvious where it is then I guess. 

[00:29:16] **Participant 3:** No, it's not. It's not very available. 

[00:29:20] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:29:23] **Participant 3:** Um, 

[00:29:26] **Luke:** I guess, um,

[00:29:30] but yeah, that's good. My project is sort of trying to help. Um, instant messaging feels a bit more like a conversation. Um, is there a lot of things that you do in a conversation like your, um, Take turns and you'll like back channels to someone. So you'll say like, oh yes. Or sure. Or you'll say that, just give indicators that you're listening and you'll also use like cues to find out if they're available or not.

[00:30:05] Like, if someone's, I don't know, you got the headphones on and they're studying intensely on their computer, then you're less likely to want to interrupt them. 

[00:30:15] **Participant 3:** Yeah. 

[00:30:16] **Luke:** So. 

[00:30:18] **Participant 3:** Ah, you know, there's a couple of things that are quite block about instant messaging, as opposed to a natural conversation is like in, in slack, you can start a sub-thread from a message.

[00:30:36] So like if you remember something, but it's like, you know, five messages back, you can respond to that specific message. And it starts like a thread underneath that message. That you can have, essentially, a new conversation in, that might be like a sub topic. You know, you might want to break it off somewhere where you might just have thought back a bit.

[00:31:00] I don't want to have to like say, oh, you know, when you said this... instant reference to, you know, the history and then you can respond to it directly again, I find that quite good. 

[00:31:15] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:31:16] **Participant 3:** And, um, and yeah, like WhatsApp, you can respond to a specific message as well, and it shows that message as a quote and then the response underneath.

[00:31:28] So to sort of, you know, same theme but slightly different implementations. 

[00:31:37] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:31:37] **Participant 3:** I find those good. 

[00:31:41] **Luke:** Um, so in what, in what context do you use those? Just any con context or is there a particular, 

[00:31:48] **Participant 3:** uh, like sometimes someone will ask me like a couple of things or you know, I, again, like, if you, if you're responding to something that's not directly the, you know, the previous message, for instance, is the message that you're actually responding to.

[00:32:07] **Luke:** Okay. Okay. So in a conversation it's impossible to do that or 

[00:32:15] **Participant 3:** Harder to do that. 

[00:32:16] **Luke:** Much harder to do that 

[00:32:18] **Participant 3:** because it's yeah. it's harder to like backtrack in a conversation.

[00:32:26] You feel like once you feel the natural conversation sort of just flowed away from something, it's

[00:32:31] a bit sort of weird to like bring it up again. 

[00:32:33] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think you've brought up a couple of times. You liked that, like times you like that history of the conversation. 

[00:32:42] **Participant 3:** Yeah 

[00:32:44] **Luke:** Um, cool. That's good to know is that, um, 

[00:32:48] **Participant 3:** especially like when I'm organizing stuff, like if I'm organizing something, you know, days, weeks in advance, it's like a clear reference to what time and date you organized the stuff.

[00:33:03] **Luke:** Um, 

[00:33:04] **Participant 3:** whereas if you just have a conversation with someone and don't write it down, like you can forget. 

[00:33:10] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, okay. That's really interesting because, um, some of the interviews I've done look at using like slack, not slack, sorry, Snapchat, which I'm sort of the opposite to that. Cause it's, um, the message is like gone. Um, within, I don't know how long after reading it, but, 

[00:33:36] **Participant 3:** and I don't like Snapchat.

[00:33:38] **Luke:** Yeah. So there's no situation where you think like some of the messages you'd be fine with them just disappearing. 

[00:33:48] **Participant 3:** Nah, I don't know why I'd want that. 

[00:33:51] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I guess, cause um, it's like a conversation I guess, is that you can just have a conversation and leave it in the past you don't have a record of everything.

[00:34:08] **Participant 3:** No, I'm someone that just likes having as much information as I can get. 

[00:34:13] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Um, all right. Well, I guess one last thing is that the. The app that I'm looking at making is based off of a previous one that they did some research on, which is this idea where you can set a status, um, just for one other person.

[00:34:39] So they did it with a study with couples and with close friends. And the idea was that you can set a status, but only when that person messages you do, they see that status. And then when they see that status, they can choose whether to send you a notification on your phone. 

[00:34:58] **Participant 3:** Oh yeah. 

[00:35:00] **Luke:** So, um, they might say like good morning and it comes up with Bob is having breakfast.

[00:35:06] And do you want to alert him? Um, so I guess how does, how does that system sound? Is that something that you think would be useful to you? 

[00:35:19] **Participant 3:** Um,

[00:35:25] I think it'd have to be more automated. 

[00:35:29] **Luke:** Yeah? 

[00:35:29] **Participant 3:** So like, if I had, um,

[00:35:37] you know, if you're talking to someone like internationally, it'd be definitely useful. like if you're at a time that you're like asleep or just don't want to be disturbed. 

[00:35:47] **Luke:** Yup.

[00:35:50] **Participant 3:** Slack actually has, um, a feature like that, where you can pause notifications. When you message them. 

[00:35:58] It says, you know, Luke's pause notifications, do you want to, do you want to send them this note notification anyway? 

[00:36:07] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:36:08] **Participant 3:** You can say yes or no. And they still, they still get the message, but it's like, whether you're pinging them with it or not. 

[00:36:14] **Luke:** Yeah. ok, 

[00:36:17] **Participant 3:** Um, so I think that would be good. And especially if like you're doing a period of work or something where you just need to be focused and not disturbed, like you can set it like or I'm doing a focus session or something. 

[00:36:34] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:36:35] **Participant 3:** But, but some if someone's messaging with something urgent, they can still push through to you.

[00:36:41] I think that would be useful. 

[00:36:42] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:36:44] **Participant 3:** And then I think if it integrated, like with your calendar or something where it's like, oh yeah, [Participant 3] is at a meeting now? Do you want to disturb them? Sort of thing? That'd be good too. 

[00:36:56] **Luke:** Okay. So you, you actually set like you meetings in your calendar? 

[00:37:01] **Participant 3:** Yeah. 

[00:37:02] **Luke:** Yeah. Cool. I guess, cause um, if you're working from home. Three days a week, right? 

[00:37:08] **Participant 3:** Yeah. But yeah, like I wouldn't be going through and putting, I started having breakfast and now I've stopped having breakfast. Like that's a lot of effort to do that unless you just set your breakfast time every morning. 

[00:37:25] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, okay. The system that they made, they had a list of previous statuses. So you didn't have to type it in and every time does that help with that at all, you 

[00:37:43] just tap it, 

[00:37:44] **Participant 3:** Can you integrate it with like, um, you know, like Siri or Google voice, whatever. Just say like, Hey, Google set my status, eating breakfast or something. That'd be really easy.

[00:38:03] **Luke:** That'd be really easy? Uh, the audio seems to have stopped again. So that would, that would be good. 

[00:38:18] **Participant 3:** Yeah, I reckon. 

[00:38:21] **Luke:** Yeah. Cool. Um, Yeah, well, that's, that's good. Everything pretty well covered. I can't really think of too much else. Is there anything that comes to mind for you? 

[00:38:31] **Participant 3:** Um, 

[00:38:39] no, I think that's good. 

[00:38:41] **Luke:** Cool. Well, thanks for that
