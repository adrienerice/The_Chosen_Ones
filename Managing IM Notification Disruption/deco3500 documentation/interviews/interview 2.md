# interview 2

[00:00:00] **Luke:** Cool. Um, so yeah, welcome to the, my, um, so yeah, I have to do the ethics thing at the beginning. So I have to say that I'm just doing research to figure out the disruptiveness of instant message notifications and how to make it a bit better. Um, less disruptive and more in tune with like the conversation, I guess.

[00:00:34] So you don't want to interrupt people in a conversation and you don't want to, um, unless it's really important information, that sort of stuff. Yeah. Uh, uh, yes, I have to say I'll, de-identify the information. So.

[00:01:15] Uh, yeah, so I'm going to de-identify information. So your name won't be in any of it. Any other names or anything that's identifying, I'll remove and I'll delete all the audio stuff. I'll just have the transcripts and I can't use it to, um, negatively reflect your, uh, um, S like, what is it standing in the community?

[00:01:45] Like I have to basically, I can't use. In the defamatory way. Yeah. Um,

[00:01:56] and, uh, cause cause there's one other thing I think I might get the printed thing.

[00:02:07] Um, yeah. And you can back out anytime you want and delete anything that you ask me to. Um, and yeah. You're you said you're okay with me. Recording audio. Cool. 

[00:02:22] **Participant 2:** Yeah, no worries.. 

[00:02:23] **Luke:** Cool. Um, so yeah. How much do you use, like instant messaging on your phone? Is it a regular thing? 

[00:02:32] **Participant 2:** Yeah, pretty regular. Yeah. 

[00:02:33] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:02:34] **Participant 2:** Yeah. Regular. 

[00:02:35] **Luke:** Is it like how many times a week? Every day? 

[00:02:39] **Participant 2:** Every day. Definitely. 

[00:02:41] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, how long have you been using instant messaging services? That could be anything from SMS to Facebook or 

[00:02:52] **Participant 2:** well, there was MSN back in that day. That's um, back ... God... 

[00:03:02] **Luke:** Just roughly. 

[00:03:02] **Participant 2:** Yeah, it would be 

[00:03:04] **Luke:** since like two-thousand... 

[00:03:06] **Participant 2:** Yeah. Since like 2003 or something like that, 2003, 2004 or something like that.

[00:03:13] I think so. 

[00:03:14] **Luke:** Yeah, about that time, it doesn't- it doesn't matter too much exactly when, but yeah, that seems about right. Um, and in terms of what you use now, do you have one preferred method of communication? Do you use multiple different services? 

[00:03:31] **Participant 2:** Use multiple different rooms since WhatsApp and Facebook messenger.

[00:03:35] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:03:36] **Participant 2:** Yeah. 

[00:03:37] **Luke:** Um, and are there any that you used to use that you don't use anymore? 

[00:03:44] **Participant 2:** Um, I think that was Snapchat had a messenger thing. I don't realy use that. Yeah. I don't really use that, and there's obviously all the old ones.like MSN which I used a long time ago. 

[00:03:57] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:03:58] **Participant 2:** I don't think there's been any other ones. Those are the main two something I always use.

[00:04:03] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, and yeah, if the ones that you do use, you said WhatsApp and Facebook messenger are the two main ones. Um, which do you prefer? 

[00:04:15] **Participant 2:** I think WhatsApp just cause it's a bit more simple and the fact that it's just removed from, you know what I mean? It's just a messenger. It's not connected -

[00:04:25] **Luke:** Okay. 

[00:04:25] **Participant 2:** -to Facebook, like the other one.

[00:04:28] And it used to actually, I think it's going out of favor now because, um, you don't have as much privacy on there as you used to I think you had to, in the latest update or something you had- I think maybe Facebook owns it now or something..

[00:04:42] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, okay, so this is the privacy aspect is the, and also just the fact it's just a messenger. 

[00:04:50] **Participant 2:** Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:04:51] **Luke:** So about- what about it being connected to Facebook is off-putting 

[00:04:57] **Participant 2:** um,

[00:05:03] I'm not sure. I'm not sure. 

[00:05:05] **Luke:** Just the general vibe?

[00:05:06] **Participant 2:** Just the fact that you're linked to, I guess you're just linked to that social media aspect, whereas WhatsApp, you're not really, it's just purely there for the messenger and sort of the layout of it. It's just, I find a little bit more straightforward and more user friendly, I think. 

[00:05:23] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, so, um, I've got one here.

[00:05:30] So in terms of who you text, is it oh, sorry. Who you message on these things? Is it, um, strictly friends or is it work and friends or is it like, how does it 

[00:05:46] **Participant 2:** Pretty much just strictly friends 

[00:05:48] **Luke:** mm 

[00:05:49] **Participant 2:** really on that. Yeah. 

[00:05:49] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:05:50] **Participant 2:** Just use, yeah, use the phone for... 

[00:05:53] **Luke:** Just use the phone for- 

[00:05:53] **Participant 2:** for all the business stuff. 

[00:05:54] Yeah. phone messenger for work-related stuff. Yeah. 

[00:05:59] **Luke:** Um, and how do you feel about the like on WhatsApp?

[00:06:05] They have the read receipts. So you can tell when someone's read your message. 

[00:06:11] **Participant 2:** Um, that is, yeah, I think that's, I think that's good. 

[00:06:16] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:06:16] **Participant 2:** Yeah. I think that's probably good. At least you can know that they've read it anyway. And they haven't- why the hell they're not getting back to you or whatever haha.

[00:06:27] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yep. That's helpful. And they also have the, um, I don't know if it's on WhatsApp, but I know it's on Facebook messenger, the last active. 

[00:06:39] **Participant 2:** Oh, I find that a bit. That can be handy, but I kind of find it a little bit strange as well at the same time. I dunno. '

[00:06:50] **Luke:** cause it. Um, does it help you to understand what the other person is doing?

[00:06:57] **Participant 2:** Yeah. I think sometimes it says, you know, someone hasn't- if they haven't responded they haven't been active for like four hours or something. I guess they're just busy, you know,cause if they're active, it's like why the hell haven't you messaged me back, but still sometimes people can still be active. I don't know. I don't know if it's, I don't know how well it works, 

[00:07:16] **Luke:** so it's not clear, like whether it's actually representing how active they actually are.

[00:07:22] Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:07:23] **Participant 2:** But sometimes. It gives you sort of an idea. 

[00:07:27] **Luke:** Um, do you think about other people seeing the last active time for you when you're on their messengers? Like, does that come to your mind at all? 

[00:07:40] **Participant 2:** No, not really. Except for the only thing is really in the context of them probably thinking why I haven't messaged back.

[00:07:47] And then at least they probably know that I haven't been active. I guess, but not, not really. 

[00:07:55] **Luke:** And um, with the messages on WhatsApp and on Facebook messenger, you can see a preview of what the message is. Do you make use of that at all? 

[00:08:10] **Participant 2:** Preview of the... 

[00:08:10] **Luke:** Like when you get a notification 

[00:08:13] **Participant 2:** Ohhhh 

[00:08:13] **Luke:** has like the name and the start of the message.

[00:08:16] **Participant 2:** Yeah. I do find that useful because at least I can sort of

[00:08:21] just get a flash of what it might be about because you know,

[00:08:25] because if it's something urgent or something that might be urgent I'm gonna have to look at it, yeah, it is sort of handy. 

[00:08:32] **Luke:** And, um, do you ever not respond to a message after reading that initial, um, preview of it? I guess like, do you not open it up? Do you just leave the notification there or is it just an easy way? 

[00:08:51] **Participant 2:** Um, I guess in some cases I would yeah. In some cases. 

[00:08:58] **Luke:** Yeah. Cool. Um, yeah, so that, that's basically the availability stuff.

[00:09:05] Cause that's one of the things I'm looking at is how do you guess when someone's available? Um, and the shortcomings of the current options, there's read receipts and there's, um, last online things they're- they're good, but it's also, like you said, it's a bit of a hit and miss sort of thing. Um, at least with the read thing, like if someone's read your message, you can see it that's pretty clear, but because you can see the preview of their message, um, because someone else can see the preview of your message.

[00:09:38] They can just see what's in the message without actually opening it. 

[00:09:41] **Participant 2:** Yeah.

[00:09:45] **Luke:** Yeah. I don't know. I guess it doesn't seem like that's too much of a factor in the way you use it. Is that right? 

[00:09:55] **Participant 2:** Yeah. 

[00:09:55] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:09:56] Yeah, not really, yeah. 

[00:09:57] Um, and when you're sending a message to someone, do you think about if they're like you can, if you, how disruptive your message might be? 

[00:10:12] **Participant 2:** Um,

[00:10:16] most of the time, not really. I don't think so. I don't think so. Most of the time, I don't know, just cause I'm more used to just getting, I dunno, messages and calls at work or whatever and just sort of used to it. So maybe, I don't know. I don't think about that so much because I'm just, 

[00:10:35] yeah, 

[00:10:36] **Luke:** no, fair enough. That's good. So other people will message you just whenever as well.

[00:10:41] **Participant 2:** Yeah, 

[00:10:42] **Luke:** yeah, 

[00:10:42] **Participant 2:** yeah, 

[00:10:43] -yeah. Um, more so if I'm calling someone, definitely. I'm also conscious of that. 

[00:10:48] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. So also, I guess, involved with this is emails, um, do you email people very much? 

[00:11:02] **Participant 2:** Um, yeah, a bit, quite a bit for work. Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:11:07] **Luke:** And, um, so you- for work you mainly call people and email them. 

[00:11:13] **Participant 2:** Yeah. 

[00:11:14] **Luke:** What's the difference between an email and a call?

[00:11:16] Like what would go in one and not the other, like what would make you want to call someone over email them? 

[00:11:21] **Participant 2:** Oh, just if I wanted something to happen straight, straight away, if you're emailing someone, it might not happen for a week or you might not even get a response. 

[00:11:33] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. 

[00:11:34] **Participant 2:** Depending on what the people are like with their emails.

[00:11:38] **Luke:** Yeah. Um,

[00:11:47] Hm. Yeah. Okay. I'm just trying to think about how I'm going to narrow the focus a bit at the moment cause, um, there's like a few different directions. I could go with things.

[00:12:05] And it's not entirely clear, which one is going to be the most useful. I might just have to go with one of them and see, um, so I guess, uh, in terms of messaging people, what would you think if you could have the option to message someone without making a notification on their phone?

[00:12:30] **Participant 2:** I suppose. Yeah, that could be an idea at least if you me- yeah. You're messaging someone at some hours that's probably a bit late and you still want to message them, but you know, and just at least want to send it or at least get them to get it, I guess at some point that could be handy. 

[00:12:48] **Luke:** Okay. Um, and are there any times where you think that that would have been handy for someone else to have done for you?

[00:12:56] Like they've sent a message and you think they didn't need to notify you.

[00:13:05] **Participant 2:** Not really. Not really. Cause I don't. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think so. It doesn't really bother me- 

[00:13:13] **Luke:** yeah. 

[00:13:13] **Participant 2:** -too much, hey. 

[00:13:14] **Luke:** Yeah. So you don't get anything that wakes you up in the middle of the night or. 

[00:13:18] **Participant 2:** No, no, no I don't have anything like that.

[00:13:20] **Luke:** You don't get any messages during the day while you're at work at all? 

[00:13:24] **Participant 2:** Yeah. 

[00:13:25] **Luke:** Does that not interrupt things? 

[00:13:29] **Participant 2:** Uh, yeah, it does. It does. Can interrupt things. Usually messages I just try and keep things brief. It's definitely more phone calls that, because at least with a message. You can just quickly message someone back or you don't have to message someone back straight away. I'd sort of rather read it for my own sake in case it is... Just cause I have needy clients freak out about small things, I guess. 

[00:13:56] **Luke:** Okay, 

[00:13:56] **Participant 2:** but it's definitely more so phone calls that when someone's talking to you, you know, on the job someone, else's talk, trying to talk to you for 10 minutes on the phone or something. 

[00:14:04] **Luke:** Um, so that's disruptive when someone's on the phone and they won't stop talking to you and it would have been better if they just sent you a message.

[00:14:12] **Participant 2:** Yeah. 

[00:14:12] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, so at work, the clients will send you messages on like texts and just texts. 

[00:14:21] **Participant 2:** Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:14:25] **Luke:** Okay. So did you prefer to call them back? You don't like texting them back? 

[00:14:29] **Participant 2:** Oh, it 

[00:14:30] depends on, depends on what it is. If it's something I actually want to discuss in detailI like calling them. So there's nothing gets sort of misconstrued in a message a bit.

[00:14:39] If it's something pretty straightforward, they're just messaging. Yeah. I'd rather just message. 

[00:14:48] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

[00:14:53] Um,

[00:14:59] okay. So sometimes the messages can be disruptive when you have like a needy client who's, um, messaging you too often, or ...?

[00:15:15] **Participant 2:** Yeah, probably. Yeah, messaging too often. Or messaging me about things that don't really matter at all, you know? 

[00:15:23] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:15:24] **Participant 2:** But yeah, I don't really have much, uh, I don't really have much of that. No, most of them pretty good hey

[00:15:32] **Luke:** um, okay. Well that's good. So the ones who are pretty good, do they message at bad times or? 

[00:15:41] **Participant 2:** Um, not really. I don't think so. I mean, yeah, probably as time goes on. I'm getting less tolerant of that sort of stuff and wanting to, you know what I mean, it'd be better just to be like, message me at only like work hours ... most of the time I don't really mind, you know, it's all good.

[00:16:08] **Luke:** So, um, what's the difference between you've already covered the difference between a text message and a phone call. But is there much of a difference between a phone call and like a face-to-face conversation with the clients? Is it easier for them to, um, get their message across face to face? 

[00:16:34] **Participant 2:** I think so.

[00:16:35] It's more so for me getting my messages, I'm a huge fan of ... I've definitely got better last couple of years, but still would rather, depending on what it is, you know. If it's something important, I'd much rather talk to someone face to face. Also there's some people on the phone, look, I have one client it's like, it's just so quiet.

[00:16:58] I put him on speaker phone. It's like up to my ears. I still can't hear what he's trying to say so.

[00:17:07] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. So, um,

[00:17:15] I'm trying to figure out, I guess, whether it would be possible to have a mess, instant message conversation. That's more like a face-to-face conversation than even a phone conversation is. Um, and some of those differences is what I'm trying to figure out specifically. So there's the importance of the information to.

[00:17:41] But, um, there's also the timing when they send you information. Would it be like when you're working, is there times where it's more convenient or less convenient to be interrupted? 

[00:17:57] **Participant 2:** Um, 

[00:18:01] well, I just depends on what I'm doing. Depends on what I'm doing really at work, but in general, I guess, not really.

[00:18:12] **Luke:** Um, cool. Well, I think that's about everything, I guess. Uh, yeah, I've got one question that I've forgot to ask, which is, do you feel a pressure to respond when you get a message? 

[00:18:25] **Participant 2:** Um, 

[00:18:27] I tell you sometimes it depends, um, what it is. Yeah. It depends on, it depends on who it is and what it is really. Yeah. So some people can be pretty demanding, you know and they're just like.

[00:18:43] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:18:44] **Participant 2:** I suppose [they] expect it. But also some of the people that are demanding and you don't really owe them anything anyway, or you don't ...context of it, you might not work for them or for them 

[00:18:57] so not really, but you know, it depends on that, but yeah, 

[00:19:00] sometimes I do. 

[00:19:04] **Luke:** Cool. Well, uh, that's everything then I guess.

[00:19:08] Thanks for that.
