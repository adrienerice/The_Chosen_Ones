# interview 4

[00:00:00] **Luke:** Um, so I have to start with the ethics thing. 

[00:00:03] **Participant 4:** Okay, yep. 

[00:00:04] **Luke:** I have to say the purpose of the study is to understand how people use their phones for instant messaging and how it's, uh, can be improved to better facilitate natural social interaction. And you can withdraw at any time. You're under no obligation to continue.

[00:00:25] You don't have to answer any questions you don't want to. 

[00:00:27] **Participant 4:** Yep. 

[00:00:28] **Luke:** I'll protect your identity, reputation, and data, I'll deidentify data and delete anything you want. you you want, and won't use it to make it look bad. I'll delete audio recordings and just keep transcriptions. 

[00:00:42] **Participant 4:** Okay. 

[00:00:42] **Luke:** And are you okay with me recording the audio of the interview?

[00:00:45] **Participant 4:** Yep, that's fine. 

[00:00:46] **Luke:** Cool, all right. So, um, first off, it's just understanding your current use of um, instant messaging. Um, so how often do you do it? I guess, is it a very regular part 

[00:01:07] of.. 

[00:01:08] **Participant 4:** Oh, A few times a week. 

[00:01:10] **Luke:** A few times a week? 

[00:01:12] **Participant 4:** Uh, it's mainly mealtimes. is one of the things combined with the [extended family surname] yeah. So we uh keep track of where the meal times are. Well, we don't know, we don't have a set time for meals,

[00:01:25] so get a message when dinner is likely to be ready. 

[00:01:28] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:01:29] **Participant 4:** It's quite handy. And then just with [wife] sort of coming and going up to [mother in law's place] and back keeping track of when she's coming back or what she's doing. Cause those times vary too. 

[00:01:39] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:01:40] **Participant 4:** That'd be the main uses and with [son] when going shopping or different times that I'll be home.

[00:01:50] Yeah, that'd be about it. 

[00:01:54] **Luke:** So yeah, a few times a week. Um, and what, uh, like services, instant messaging services. Do you 

[00:02:04] use at the moment? 

[00:02:06] **Participant 4:** Uh, WhatsApp is WhatsApp and messenger. 

[00:02:09] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:02:09] **Participant 4:** Two main ones,

[00:02:14] um, texts. I probably use it with staff sometimes if they're away. Um, 

[00:02:23] **Luke:** yeah. That's, 

[00:02:24] **Participant 4:** that's not very often. 

[00:02:26] **Luke:** Yeah. What do you use email with that with them? 

[00:02:31] **Participant 4:** Yep. Yep. So, usually uh, when the wages are paid there's an email sent with the details on what the wage payments, where. It's confirmed, it's gone into their bank account.

[00:02:42] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, uh, So you use WhatsApp and messenger, um, and it text messages. Uh, do you have a preference for any of them? 

[00:02:58] **Participant 4:** Um, uh, suppose WhatsApp's one that I can find it easier to use or, I've got it set up, so it's easy to use.

[00:03:16] **Luke:** Is that w which parts of it makes it easier to use, 

[00:03:21] **Participant 4:** uh, suppose it's familiarity with the way it's set up. That's one thing. It makes it easier. Um, probably use it. Well, usually I use it more often. What's more with the immediate family. So use it more often. Messenger only started using it more recently because of the, um, you know, with the, uh, dinner with the [extended family surname]

[00:03:49] I sort of use that more for that. So, um, yeah, only started using it more recently and

[00:04:02] yeah, I suppose one of the things with that I just use the the uh thumbs up, so I've been used to using texts sort of thing where I've Put in words and the little pictogram ones or something. I'm not all that familiar with. But having a thumbs up, sitting there ready you can click on it. It's very handy. 

[00:04:23] **Luke:** Um,

[00:04:27] okay. Um,

[00:04:35] how does sending a message differ from face-to-face conversation. Is it, um, 

[00:04:44] **Participant 4:** Oh it's usually just about simple messages. Yes or no, or this time, or that time. Um, emails and texts, are more questions or something that might need a bit more discussion, asking for more information or providing a bit more background and things.

[00:05:08] Texts and more conversational too. Whereas the messages are very sort of point-like or just very specific little bits. 

[00:05:16] **Luke:** Okay. Yep. Um, so the text messages, are more conversational. 

[00:05:27] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:05:28] **Luke:** Okay. And, uh, that's between you and um, the staff? 

[00:05:37] **Participant 4:** Oh, not so much, it's more with [wife] you know, if I'm sending a more detailed message on finding out what she's up to or what she's doing at the shops.

[00:05:46] Um, or she sent a photo or something, so that sort of more conversational, the staff can be more finding out more information, um, more details on what's going on.

[00:06:02] **Luke:** Oh, yeah, I see. Yeah. I'm sorry. I thought you meant SMS, like texts texting just meant like the text itself is more, whereas yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, cool. Uh,

[00:06:22] and

[00:06:27] how do you feel about it in general? The instant messaging stuff. 

[00:06:32] **Participant 4:** Um, yeah, it's very handy, very useful, as long as I can get a signal. So that's where the, uh, using the wifi is handy when I do that, because the internet signal is not all that useful here. Very hard to get a signal on my phone and even at work it's, I'm not very good internet connection.

[00:06:54] So the wifi is a useful aspect. When you're in an area where you can use wifi, uh, which is usually I'll do messages sort of. Um,

[00:07:14] yeah. So, um, what was the question again? 

[00:07:18] **Luke:** It's more like, uh, do you, do you, would you prefer to, um, like receive an email or talk face-to-face with someone other than sending an instant message? Like, is there any ways in which, uh, or, or maybe you prefer instant messaging? Is there, is there some way that it's got some benefits over those other ways of communicating or is it worse in some ways?

[00:07:42] **Participant 4:** Oh, it's very good. The benefits are in those short points. Just about what time something is on so you can find out little bits of information or letting someone know that you'll be somewhere at a certain point in time. 

[00:07:55] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:07:57] **Participant 4:** Or a specific question or list of things to get from the shops. 

[00:08:00] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:08:01] **Participant 4:** So it's, um, very specific little points.

[00:08:05] It's very strong, very helpful for that. As long as I've got a signal, that's where, uh, um, if you're dri-, well, if you're driving and if you can do hands free and, um, it's not all that helpful. Cause we don't get which no signal, And even, um, yeah. The text messages, SMS sort of with mobile phones, not very helpful at home either because no signal.

[00:08:35] **Luke:** Yep. 

[00:08:36] **Participant 4:** Even at work. So that's where the instant message services on wifi have an advantage because usually the wifi is more readily available for us or for me, at least in the, um, yeah. 

[00:08:51] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, okay. On, um, WhatsApp and Facebook, they have the read receipts. Uh, do you know what those are? 

[00:09:12] **Participant 4:** No. No, just the double tick is what you've mentioned for 

[00:09:15] **Luke:** Yeah 

[00:09:16] **Participant 4:** WhatsApp,is that what you mean? 

[00:09:18] **Luke:** Yep. 

[00:09:19] **Participant 4:** Yeah. I've only learned about that from yourself. So. otherwise I had no idea about it. 

[00:09:24] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. So that was just recently. 

[00:09:26] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:09:26] **Luke:** Yeah. And.. 

[00:09:30] **Participant 4:** The only way I'd know if it was red as if I got a reply from them sort of 

[00:09:33] **Luke:** yeah. 

[00:09:33] **Participant 4:** making a comment or thumbs up or something else.

[00:09:37] **Luke:** And, um,

[00:09:42] so

[00:09:46] there's also, um,

[00:09:50] uh, uh, Status that's tells you if someone is active now or the last time that they were on mine. 

[00:10:01] **Participant 4:** Yeah. I wouldn't know where to look for those. I'm a pretty basic user of these things and I don't know much about them. Yeah. Um, 

[00:10:11] **Luke:** it also says if they're typing, when they're typing it in. 

[00:10:16] **Participant 4:** Yeah, I haven't seen it. I don't know that one.

[00:10:17] I've only seen it on the live bots the chat things on.. When you're online getting information from some company. 

[00:10:25] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. 

[00:10:26] **Participant 4:** It says, you know, they're typing or, 

[00:10:28] **Luke:** yeah. Okay. 

[00:10:29] **Participant 4:** But I don't know about it on WhatsApp or messenger. I've got an idea about it then. 

[00:10:35] **Luke:** So on the online thing, is that a useful thing to have?

[00:10:43] **Participant 4:** Yeah. up to a point it has been, um, it gets some of the basic questions but uh, sometimes if I ask a more obscure question or don't know how to- my wording or expression might be not quite what it can pick up on. 

[00:10:57] **Luke:** Okay. So it's, it's just the robot, like replying to you. It's not actually a human being? 

[00:11:03] **Participant 4:** Oh most of the time it's a robot. There was once or twice. I remember a person, but the person one is definitely more flexible. Yeah. 

[00:11:12] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:11:12] **Participant 4:** More responsive. 

[00:11:13] **Luke:** So even when it was a robot, it was still, it still had that typing. 

[00:11:17] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:11:18] **Luke:** Okay. So, um, having that thing, showing that it was typing something, was that helpful? 

[00:11:24] **Participant 4:** Yes. Yeah. That's helpful to know there's a response coming.

[00:11:28] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. Um, um, I guess, I don't know how much of. Uh, communication you've done with real customer service people through those things, but has there ever been a time where they've been typing and then a message hasn't come through? 

[00:11:52] **Participant 4:** No, no, it's always worked. 

[00:11:54] **Luke:** Yep. Um, okay. So that's sort of part of it, I guess, is that the other part is, do you think about. When you send messages, like whether the other person is busy or..? 

[00:12:13] **Participant 4:** Uh, generally not, no. 

[00:12:16] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:12:17] **Participant 4:** I just assume that they'll uh, see it when they've got a chance or you know if it beeps or 

[00:12:24] **Luke:** yeah. 

[00:12:24] **Participant 4:** They'll realize that there's a message come through. There's the sound signal and reply to it when they can. 

[00:12:33] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. So. Uh, it's not as much of a conversation like a, um, synchronous sort of thing. It's not so much a thing where it's like, you're talking to someone else in the same room? 

[00:12:46] **Participant 4:** No, no. I use that differently. It's more like a little point to sort out, you know, whether it's the time that dinner's on or something like that, and just wait for a reply. So I'm not expecting to get a reply straight away. Sometimes do. 

[00:13:02] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:13:03] **Participant 4:** Othertimes when it turns up.

[00:13:07] **Luke:** Um, so you only know if someone's seen the messages when you get the reply from them? 

[00:13:13] **Participant 4:** Yeah, that's it. 

[00:13:14] **Luke:** Yeah. Um,

[00:13:19] and

[00:13:28] so is.

[00:13:34] Um,

[00:13:40] so you're more available on the email when you're at work? 

[00:13:45] **Participant 4:** Yeah. Just cause the, um, between patients I'll be looking at the computer to check, uh, cause it comes up with the name of the next person there and it tells me what time they've arrived. And I can see the little email symbol, if there's new email there and usually have a few spare seconds, I can just check and see and, uh,, sometimes I'll see a message that needs a timely reply or something I think it's important to get onto, and I can answer it between patients. I just have it handy and set up there, you know, messages come through and I just automatically look at it when there's something there when I get a chance. 

[00:14:30] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, and you don't have your phone with you all the time? 

[00:14:37] **Participant 4:** No, not at work. Um, sort of either tucked away in the drawer or on charge. Uh, and as I said, the there's, uh, the signals- it doesn't get a signal. 

[00:14:49] **Luke:** Even with the wifi, doesn't get a signal? 

[00:14:52] **Participant 4:** There's a wifi signal. So it'll pick up on a WhatsApp, messenger. But um, occasionally there will be a telephone- it rings and when I've answered it, there's no answer because- it's somehow it's got a signal to ring, but there doesn't been any further signal at all provide any other voice or anything else. 

[00:15:14] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:15:15] **Participant 4:** It's because we're in such a poor area. 

[00:15:18] **Luke:** Um, okay, so you can't get any text messages either, I guess, 

[00:15:23] **Participant 4:** Generally not. 

[00:15:23] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Um, and so outside of work, do you have your phone with you? 

[00:15:32] **Participant 4:** Most of the time, yeah, just driving the car is. Um, I just tend to ignore it a bit then.

[00:15:38] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:15:39] **Participant 4:** Uh, That's where you can see some of the other hand strain, the little dashboard, the steering wheel controls and things could be handy. 

[00:15:48] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:15:49] **Participant 4:** But it's not that often only get cars and get a message on the phones. It's more, if you think of something that you'd like to send a message. 

[00:15:55] **Luke:** Okay. 

[00:15:56] **Participant 4:** That's where it might be handy.

[00:15:57] **Luke:** Yeah. Um, and so when you get a message, do you feel like you have to respond to it? In a timely way. 

[00:16:13] **Participant 4:** Yeah. Usually, usually that those sort of messages are more time dependent or something that's happening or 

[00:16:21] **Luke:** yeah. 

[00:16:22] **Participant 4:** So yeah I see those more as more urgent things. 

[00:16:26] **Luke:** Okay. Um, and, um, have you. had Uh, any notifications or text messages pop up bad times? 

[00:16:47] **Participant 4:** Oh, usually the scam calls. I get a few of those. they seem to come in bursts. There's been a few more recently and the phone will ring or buzz or something and I'll ignore it and and then when I get a chance to have a look at it and see it was just totally unknown number or something like uh, please. Uh, link go to this link for some parcel that's being sent to which you never knew anything about seem like obvious scams but 

[00:17:16] **Luke:** yeah. 

[00:17:16] **Participant 4:** so they're the main things that turn up at weird times or difficult times 

[00:17:20] **Luke:** Okay. 

[00:17:21] **Participant 4:** Otherwise um not really, it's the only the accountant at one stage were trying to communicate via text messages. I had to send them a- finally they got the message that email's the best way to communicate with me. So they were one group and, um, that's probably the main actually was, it would be the account. they're the ones that like to use text messages a bit, which could turn up time- during the day and it should be good to send a reply to them cause that was something which was needed a bit more urgent attention. I'd I wouldn't see it till the end of the day or after office hours. 

[00:18:04] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:18:05] **Participant 4:** So as I said email's the best way to get in touch with me. 

[00:18:08] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. So it's interesting. Cause it seems like from the other interviews I've done, um, people are more responsive through messengers rather than email.

[00:18:23] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:18:24] **Luke:** Um, but 

[00:18:27] **Participant 4:** uh, just a function of how I've got it set up. 

[00:18:32] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:18:33] **Participant 4:** Just the convenience for the emails. They're looking at the computer doing things. 

[00:18:38] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:18:38] **Participant 4:** Between times. So I can see all these emails have come in. So then I can have a quick look and see 

[00:18:44] **Luke:** yeah, 

[00:18:45] **Participant 4:** otherwise the phone I'd have to go to a separate area to get the phone, switch it on to, you know, click on the app.

[00:18:53] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:18:54] **Participant 4:** It's not so easy. It's just not convenient the way I've got it set up the way I operate.

[00:19:02] **Luke:** So there are, um, you can access like, uh, for instance, Facebook messenger through the computer as well. 

[00:19:10] **Participant 4:** Yeah. But, um, it's, uh, that's something that I've really gone into. 

[00:19:18] **Luke:** And I guess, I guess partly because, um, I mean, there is a difference between the two, right. What's that for you? What's the difference between an email message and an email and Facebook messenger message. You said that the Face- 

[00:19:37] **Participant 4:** email is usually a little bit more detail needed whereas Facebook is using, or just one point of simple sort of thing and emails it's much more wide ranging. So there's a lot of different work things that, are Related to work anyway. so it might be the dental association, things come through, afrom the specialist we get letters back from a specialist via email. 

[00:20:04] **Luke:** Okay. Yeah. Okay. 

[00:20:06] **Participant 4:** Accountant, financial advisor and there's CPD (Continuing Professional Development) things, specials, a lot of the dental companies send their specials. out they send emails, some of them more than once a week. Start to become a bit too many. So there's a lot more sent via email to me. 

[00:20:24] **Luke:** Yep. And some of that sounds like it's time sensitive. 

[00:20:29] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:20:30] **Luke:** Yeah. So it's um, so you tend to respond to emails fairly quickly? 

[00:20:39] **Participant 4:** Yep, generally do.

[00:20:40] **Luke:** When they're time-sensitive. 

[00:20:41] **Participant 4:** Yeah, 

[00:20:41] **Luke:** yeah. Yup. Um, would you say it's quicker than the messages on the phone?

[00:20:48] =I guess it depends a bit. 

[00:20:52] **Participant 4:** Only in the sense that not the way I've set it up, I sort of, you know, I've got a habit going and yeah, I've got to set there, ready to go. So I look at it all the time.Oh there's a message, I can send a reply quickly, but the WhatsApp is pretty good. The messenger with its little thumbs up is simple and quick and easy.

[00:21:08] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:21:08] **Participant 4:** That's just for meal times. So that's fairly specific and short. 

[00:21:14] **Luke:** Uh, is there any raising that you can think of that it is set up this way? 

[00:21:20] **Participant 4:** Uh, just the habits, it's just the way I got, you know, the way I got got started on. 

[00:21:24] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:21:25] **Participant 4:** Um, no particular reason. 

[00:21:29] **Luke:** So the habits for email were already there before the messenger stuff came along?

[00:21:35] **Participant 4:** Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:21:37] **Luke:** Um, I guess I didn't ask, how long do you think you've been using the instant messaging stuff for 

[00:21:44] **Participant 4:** Yeah, well, that's the other thing, I've been using emails for a long time. instant messaging only, um,, um, uh, well, a messenger only within you know really use- seen it around, but only used it in the last couple of years.

[00:22:00] WhatsApp, probably a little bit longer, but not that long either. So I'm a bit slow on sort of pick up on some of these things. 

[00:22:08] **Luke:** Yeah, well, it's, um, it's, uh, not really. You know, a good or a bad thing to pick it, pick it up sooner or later, it's more just figuring out what the differences are and how they could be more useful.

[00:22:26] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:22:27] **Luke:** Um, or, yeah. Um,

[00:22:38] so.

[00:22:43] Yeah. So you think you don't really think about what other people might be busy or something when you send them a message? 

[00:22:56] **Participant 4:** No. The, um, when with messaging usually it's in response it's yeah. I don't know if I initiate the things on them. so it's usually in response. So if someone's sent a message I'm assuming, I would like a reply at some stage.

[00:23:12] Uh, so I assume they'll be doing things and they can keep an eye out for any messages that come through. Yeah. So, cause yeah usually I do as a respondent- responding sort of situation rather than initiating is when I say meal- dinner will be at this time and I assume they'll be looking out for what time dinner will be anyway.

[00:23:32] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:23:33] **Participant 4:** And expecting something. 

[00:23:34] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:23:34] **Participant 4:** Um, Probably don't ever really send message out of the blue. 

[00:23:40] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. So there's never been like it too late at night or something.

[00:23:51] **Participant 4:** I mean, with [wife] when she's at [mother in law's]. She sent through a question once and I sent a reply back it was on WhatsApp and she said ah ok I'm off the bed now. So yeah she just sort of said that's enough now. 

[00:24:11] **Luke:** Okay. Yeah. Um, 

[00:24:17] **Participant 4:** so it hasn't been, other times as I said I generally don't initiate so many messages, uh, 

[00:24:24] **Luke:** yeah.

[00:24:24] **Participant 4:** Uh, with responding, you know, the other person's well, you assume they're looking for, or keeping it half an eye out for a reply. 

[00:24:35] **Luke:** Cool 

[00:24:36] **Participant 4:** Just the way I tend to use it. 

[00:24:38] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Um, so, um, is there anything that's like better or worse? Instant messaging compared to like face-to-face conversations. I don't know. It's a bit of a broad question, but do you have a preference for one over the other? 

[00:25:14] **Participant 4:** Yeah, it's different. Um, so the Tinder is just for the short little points, whereas convers- face-to-face is more conversation sort of discussing things in looking at things from different angles.

[00:25:27] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:25:30] **Participant 4:** Sharing a laugh sort of more entertaining type things. Yeah. Um, so it has a different purpose. So you just sort of use it differently where it's seen as helpful or useful as just for those short points. Whereas conversation is, you said that's different again. Yeah. So it has a different function to conversation.

[00:25:51] So just the way to use it. So it's a bit hard to compare them because we use it differently. Just sort of say, you know, this is a strength of it is this conversation is a lot more to and fro and, uh, discussing things, looking at things from different angles, which requires sort of more feedback. And you see how people respond is all the, the nonverbal communication to yeah.

[00:26:17] Just doesn't happen on the text message. 

[00:26:20] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:26:20] **Participant 4:** So that that's more sort of a. Factual or a simple points. So just a simple level, sort of low level type conversation in that sense or very basic level. It was a face-to-face there's a lot more, you know you see how people are responding, whether you go further discussing things in that area, whether you try something from a different angle or talk about something different or yeah.

[00:26:45] So it's quite a bit different. 

[00:26:47] **Luke:** Yeah. Do you think it would be useful.. Well, I guess so with the instant messaging, um, you're saying there's all those like, uh, social cues and things from body language and all the rest of it. Is it, um, do you think that instant messaging would benefit if it could get some of that? 

[00:27:18] **Participant 4:** There's been a couple of people that use the emoji things more. 

[00:27:23] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:27:24] **Participant 4:** And, uh, sort of a useful in that sense that you get an idea that this person thinks this is funny or, um, they're exclaiming or so they're helpful. 

[00:27:36] **Luke:** A bit more expressive? 

[00:27:37] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:27:40] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. So, so that that's helpful in that sense. Yeah. Um, how well, how well do you try to understand another person's state of mind through their messages? Is that something that ever pops up or is it just informational? 

[00:28:06] **Participant 4:** Uh, that's not, yeah, that's more than mild when there's a little bit more going on. Not so much in messaging 

[00:28:13] **Luke:** okay. Like the, uh,

[00:28:15] **Participant 4:** I suppose the only one is [wife] is the only one that sends longer messages. 

[00:28:21] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:28:22] **Participant 4:** Some photos and things. or comments, about [mother in law] or something. So that's really the only ones a bit more expressive, more involved. 

[00:28:31] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:28:32] **Participant 4:** Yeah. Most of the time it's just simple things. 

[00:28:36] **Luke:** Okay. One of the, um, well, the inspiration for the prototype that I'll be making, or at least part of the inspiration for it is this previous paper where they made an app, that it would let you, um, it was aimed at couples and friends. So it would let you set a status that, that other person could be. But they could only read it when they sent you a message and it would come up with, um, little alert box saying um, you know, Bob is having breakfast. Would you like to alert him or not alert him? So, um, you could say alert and it would actually make the notification on their phone or it would not alert them. So, I guess, does that sound like it would be useful at all, given your current usage? 

[00:29:49] **Participant 4:** Um, probably not, but, uh, it may do. I mean, I haven't sort of, um, really thought about what the other person's doing, um, yeah. Well, as I said, I would tend to be more responding to messages. 

[00:30:10] **Luke:** Yeah. Do you, yeah. So you don't mind like, um, I guess even with the email, because you get email alerts on your computer, do they turn up at any inconvenient times or is that just, 

[00:30:25] **Participant 4:** I just look at them when I can, so yeah, they'll turn up. 

[00:30:28] **Luke:** It's not really- 

[00:30:29] **Participant 4:** Well the ones from overseas turn up at 2:00 AM so I don't look at those until the next day, but yeah, no, you know, look they're um.

[00:30:39] Yeah.

[00:30:43] I just look at them when I can say, so it sort of just accumulates. 

[00:30:48] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:30:50] **Participant 4:** And yeah, I mean, can miss some that way. You get a lot accumulating and go back to looking and then don't get enough time to get through it all. And then the next day goes by and you accumulate more and then can end up missing some emails that way. 

[00:31:05] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:31:05] **Participant 4:** Uh, so in the sense it would be useful that you'd know a certain party had sent a message. 

[00:31:12] **Luke:** Yep. 

[00:31:13] **Participant 4:** So that would be an advantage. Yeah. 

[00:31:16] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Um,

[00:31:25] is there anything about the effect that the email is just on the desktop computer? actually, Is it just on the desktop computer at work? 

[00:31:36] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:31:37] **Luke:** The alerts that is, they just show up on the desktop computer at work. 

[00:31:40] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:31:41] **Luke:** Is there anything about that? That's um, you prefer because it's just in the one place, does that seem like a benefit to it in any way?

[00:31:50] **Participant 4:** Yeah, it's a convenience factor. Definitely. 

[00:31:52] **Luke:** Yeah. It's more convenient to have it all in one place, 

[00:31:55] **Participant 4:** yeah, 

[00:31:55] **Luke:** rather than I like, is it sort of.

[00:32:03] A bit easier to manage rather than having your phone on you and being able to be notified at any time. 

[00:32:10] **Participant 4:** Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Cause I'm working on the computer, you know, between patient always doing notes, sending details through to the front desk and uh, cause of opening and closing things. I can see there's all little icons across the bottom or there's new emails there. 

[00:32:27] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:32:28] **Participant 4:** And. And a few seconds between times to have a quick look. 

[00:32:32] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:32:32] **Participant 4:** So this one, I should act on this one. I can forget about at all or delete this one or file this one for later so I can see what's going on there during the day. So it's convenience, just having it there and a little alert symbol, lets me know something's come in. 

[00:32:49] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:32:50] **Participant 4:** And I can have a look and because it's got the titles to them, you know who it's from and topic

[00:32:57] **Luke:** yeah. 

[00:32:58] **Participant 4:** And time it was sent, that's like a little content sort of thing. So I can just see there's a number there, I can just flick through and oh this ones, one I should look at, and others I just ignore until the end of the day or delete them if they're advertising things, it's having that, like a contents list is quite helpful.

[00:33:15] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, I guess is it, uh, my, I was sort of wondering if, um, when you're at the computer that at the desktop computer there, you're always, um, ready to be reading the emails or at least ready to be receiving emails. Well, I mean, maybe not always, but it's a. How do I say it..., 

[00:33:51] **Participant 4:** well, if it's convenience thing, so some days I'll be busy and I won't look at them. 

[00:33:55] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:33:56] **Participant 4:** All morningor all afternoon. 

[00:33:58] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:33:59] **Participant 4:** it's onlyat the end of the session that I'll have a look other times there's a bit more time in between and I can have a look. 

[00:34:06] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:34:07] **Participant 4:** So it is very much just depends on the day. 

[00:34:10] **Luke:** I guess. I'm trying to get a sense of how much does the computer notify you? Um, while you're doing something else.

[00:34:18] And how much of it is you just looking when you ready to look at it? 

[00:34:22] **Participant 4:** Yeah. Well, it gives a little sound signal. I know. Oh, there's another email arrived. 

[00:34:26] **Luke:** Yep. 

[00:34:26] **Participant 4:** So I can hear that while I'm working. So that's very useful. I know emails are there. 

[00:34:32] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:34:32] **Participant 4:** And then it's more me looking at it when I get a chance.

[00:34:35] **Luke:** Okay. And

[00:34:37] **Participant 4:** so the audio notification is helpful for as a first instance. 

[00:34:43] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:34:44] **Participant 4:** It's just one sounds signal. 

[00:34:46] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:34:46] **Participant 4:** So just email. It could be anything. 

[00:34:48] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:34:49] **Participant 4:** And then, um, it's really, we all get time to have a look too, you know, it's just up to my convenience then as to. 

[00:34:56] **Luke:** Yeah. okay 

[00:34:57] **Participant 4:** see what's going on? 

[00:34:58] **Luke:** Does it put any pressure on you to go and have a look at it to find out what it is?

[00:35:02] **Participant 4:** No, 

[00:35:03] **Luke:** no, 

[00:35:04] **Participant 4:** no, I just ignore it. 

[00:35:06] **Luke:** Is it, you said that some of the emails they're a bit more time sensitive, but they're not like urgent, I guess then that you don't need to go and check them immediately. 

[00:35:15] **Participant 4:** Generally not. No. 

[00:35:16] **Luke:** Yeah. So, um, would it be, I guess, I don't know how often you're likely to get an email that's really requires urgent attention I guess 

[00:35:30] **Participant 4:** most of them are usually within a couple of days. 

[00:35:33] **Luke:** Okay. 

[00:35:34] **Participant 4:** So very short term. 

[00:35:36] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:35:37] **Participant 4:** not I can remember anyway, occasionally get them where they put their exclamation mark on and all the rest of it and say, yeah, you know, you need to act on this within, by the end of the week or within two days and you've only got.... 

[00:35:52] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay.

[00:35:53] **Participant 4:** One or two days notice. 

[00:35:54] **Luke:** Yeah. Whereas it's um, I guess if it was a real like emergency or anything, they just call or use some other

[00:36:03] **Participant 4:** yeah. The dental association sent out text messages when it was COVID-19 as well. when that first started cause we got emails from them saying this new guidelines, these restrictions apply from tomorrow.

[00:36:16] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:36:16] **Participant 4:** Okay. 

[00:36:18] And they sent that by text as well, sort of covering all the different channels of communication to make sure dentists got the message ASAP. 

[00:36:26] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:36:28] **Participant 4:** Cause that was a very, the COVID-19 was actually an example of. Uh, urgent messages that were sent all the different ways to make sure like dentists did see it, but, um, I saw that on an email first before the phone.

[00:36:43] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:36:43] **Participant 4:** Cause I'd sort of had a look at the phone later on and then oh yeah it's coming from them as well. 

[00:36:47] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. cool., 

[00:36:51] **Participant 4:** actually the other one is um... Just thinking with some of the dental conferences. The big meetings, at congresses they'd have, uh, an app for the Congress. And, uh, that would notify you of it's more like a, sponsor's sort of doing things or something on in the reception area or somewhere else. Uh, and then there was just general conversation areas as well.

[00:37:28] So that's sort of more specific app for dental conferences is one that. you know,, I'd have to have my phone with me and that was one that I had to start looking at the phone more often to see what was going on during the conference. Um, so yeah that, that's true. theoir their conference apps sort of, uh, dental, the Australian dental Congress.

[00:37:46] That was something you need to look at regularly to get the up-to-date messages. You know, they'd say oh, for morning tea this is happening and it was the start a morning tea, or I'dget half an hours notice at the most, some of the things. 

[00:38:01] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. And was that, um, was that positive or negative? 

[00:38:12] **Participant 4:** Uh, different because I said I haven't used that much that way, so I had to get a new habit of checking the phone. 

[00:38:20] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. 

[00:38:21] **Participant 4:** It was very useful. It was good in that. Um, you didn't have to listen out for him speaker over the, you know, the, um, in the halls of the meetings sort of they have like a, a loud speaker thing usedto say alert everyone to such and such. so you didn't have to listen out for that, which is, you know, depending where you were and sound distortion, not so good. So that was very useful in that sense that you, a little beep on the phone or buzz and go something's going on there. The message had come through. 

[00:38:48] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. 

[00:38:49] **Participant 4:** See the app. 

[00:38:50] **Luke:** Yep. 

[00:38:51] **Participant 4:** Um, so it was actually, it's quite good, quite handy.

[00:38:58] **Luke:** Did that, um, make you, did that make you think about getting messages from other people at all? 

[00:39:08] **Participant 4:** Um, not really. 

[00:39:11] **Luke:** Not really. 

[00:39:13] **Participant 4:** Pretty slow to change habits. 

[00:39:16] **Luke:** No, no. What so, you know, 

[00:39:18] **Participant 4:** especially when you know you've got plenty of other things going on anyway. 

[00:39:22] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:39:22] **Participant 4:** keep busy enough. 

[00:39:23] **Luke:** Yeah. Well, I think that, um, one of the things that has been interesting about this is it seems like everyone has a different way that they've tried, tried to solve the problems, 

[00:39:36] **Participant 4:** just how you communicate and make use of the technology.

[00:39:40] Um, convenience is sort of, one of the things for me is just sort of what's what's handy there. 

[00:39:45] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, you know, what's convenient for your approach, um, might not be convenient for someone else. 

[00:39:53] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:39:54] **Luke:** But yeah. They might also not be aware of that. This is a possible approach. 

[00:40:02] **Participant 4:** Yeah that's where it was interesting with the COVID-19 that the dental associate just used every channel they could. 

[00:40:07] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:40:07] **Participant 4:** Sent out different ways' to alert people. 

[00:40:10] **Luke:** Hmm, 

[00:40:11] **Participant 4:** You know, I mean, I don't do the social media. They, they got social media aspects, you know, they cover the whole lot, but I haven't gotten involved in Facebook groups and Instagrams and things, whatever else they got. they cover, They actually got all the social media things. I've not bothered with any of that.

[00:40:34] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Um, so a lot of people use instant messaging to have like a conversation, I guess. Um, but, but they try to make it, they try to do it, um, as much like a face to face conversation as possible in some senses. Um, what w what would it be like if you tried to do well? 

[00:41:04] **Participant 4:** I just thought of zoom meetings. It's sort of where it's most useful. 

[00:41:07] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. 

[00:41:08] **Participant 4:** Uh, teams meeting. So the, I mean, with [brother] and [sister] you know, my brother and sister, so with the looking after mum's estate, that was helpful. So had that weekly meeting going on for six months, more.. 12 months would have been 12 months and scaled it back just to once a month now. 

[00:41:32] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:41:33] **Participant 4:** But that's quite handy to have to have a conversation, get a bit more insight into what they're doing as well. So it'd be the social chitchat as well as organizing things. So that was, um, so having the, um, zoom, you know, the video call type thing is, and certainly, um, Very helpful from it, with that. 

[00:41:55] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. So yeah, 

[00:41:57] **Participant 4:** even with the other calls have been the financial advisor, the accountants I've done it sort of with meetings, the, um, there's webinars where they do open up for questions. That's generally been just a checkbox, you know, sort of, sort of, um, rather text. Question's going in occasionally they'll have it where you can do by picture let's.

[00:42:26] There was one which one? It was where I use the Palm tree background. I did that for the tropics. So anyway, most of the conversations would have been the zoom or teams meetings sort of things. 

[00:42:43] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. 

[00:42:45] **Participant 4:** Yeah. I haven't. Got involved in messaging is sort of conversational thing. 

[00:42:53] **Luke:** Um, yeah. Okay. That's interesting. So it's uh, um, I guess so, so you'd prefer to at least have a audio, like a phone call or a video call. 

[00:43:12] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:43:12] **Luke:** Yeah. Much easier to have a conversation 

[00:43:14] through that? 

[00:43:15] **Participant 4:** Yeah. 

[00:43:16] **Luke:** Um, is that just because of the, like, um, what, what if someone's like not available for a phone call, you just try and set a phone call up or, 

[00:43:33] **Participant 4:** yeah, I'll just think of a time that's going to be convenient to ring or find out what's a good time.

[00:43:38] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's interesting. Yes. Yeah, I guess there's, uh, uh, I'd say probably fairly prevalent behavior where people will just have a conversation through the texts, uh, like instant messages. 

[00:43:59] **Participant 4:** Yeah, yeah. Um, on an older demographic and 

[00:44:02] **Luke:** yeah. 

[00:44:03] **Participant 4:** It's what your habits are. 

[00:44:04] **Luke:** Yeah. I mean, um, I guess, I guess I'll say it's the speed of using the keyboard is probably, 

[00:44:17] **Participant 4:** definitely 

[00:44:17] **Luke:** makes it harder to have a conversation.

[00:44:20] **Participant 4:** Well, I'd need to have glasses on and always have those with me. Yeah. All the different areas and, uh, yeah, that's true. Um, it is slower. 

[00:44:28] **Luke:** Yeah. Well, they have the speech to text stuff. Um, have you made use of that at all? 

[00:44:36] **Participant 4:** No. 

[00:44:37] **Luke:** And it's interesting. I don't know. Uh, I think it's, I think it's used by Chinese speaking people because it's quicker than typing in Chinese to use the audio message where you record a little message and send it, um, has that maybe something you've seen at all or used at all?

[00:44:59] **Participant 4:** Um, um, I haven't, uh, not even recorded, uh, at workshop. So, for example, I have eight workshops out in the field talking about plants and things, uh, other workshops. So I've just do an audio recording, not actually as a conversation. 

[00:45:21] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well, it's um, well, you know, the, you know, the read receipts. Currently typing stuff, those things I was talking about before. Yeah. Do you think that they at all useful or do you think you'll make use 

[00:45:43] of them at all? 

[00:45:44] **Participant 4:** Yeah, no,it'd be handy to know, um, just have to see, as i said, find my way around the little apps, 

[00:45:50] **Luke:** yeah. Okay. So it's not, they're not very clear at the moment for you.

[00:45:54] **Participant 4:** No, I got no idea about them. So I haven't, that's one of the things that slows me down with. You've gotta learn where things are set out and how to use them. So it is, there's a learning process involved. So when you've got something you're doing routinely and don't a lot of spare time, or can't see obvious, you may not be aware of what benefits there'd be, don't often go looking to see what are the features on those things. 

[00:46:21] **Luke:** Yeah. Yup. Uh it's um, it's interesting. Cause, uh, that, yeah, there might be different one. Of them setting it out so that, uh, designing that so that it's a bit more obvious, 

[00:46:39] **Participant 4:** the introductory tutorial thing for users. So it's very quick and easy sort of introduction could be handy and they've probably got, got little help things or things that they can find out.

[00:46:48] But often you've got to go to know what you're looking for, putting a key word or whatever, and yeah. Um, yeah, some little introductory. I don't know somewhere. I'd make it very user-friendly to introduce the features. 

[00:47:04] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:47:04] **Participant 4:** Whether it's a video or audio or audio visual part from a text reference manual. 

[00:47:11] **Luke:** Yup. Yeah, no, that's true. But, um, or Snapchat is that another messaging service and on there they have messages where you send it and then after the person is. It'll disappear after a couple hours. Um, does that seem like it would be of interest or? I don't know. What does that sound like to you in terms of feature 

[00:47:45] **Participant 4:** having messages disappears? Probably, uh, I tend to be someone who likes to archive things a bit, so I can refer back to things later on or. So I just have that tendency to want to archive things. 

[00:48:02] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:48:03] **Participant 4:** So I probably wouldn't find it all at you. Um, I mean for thew little simple messages, it's be fine. Occasionally you sort of wanna, um, contact details or if it's only someone you're contacting sporadically,might have forgotten some details about them and want to go back through your messages to see. 

[00:48:26] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So it's um, yeah, I mean, that that's, that seems to be the two opposing things to this is that it's makes it harder to go back and see what has been said before. But sometimes that, um, makes it more like a conversation. Um, because it's not like a record of everything that's been said. Um,

[00:49:00] yeah, no, it's interesting. Um, another, another feature, I guess, on these things that, uh, is you can reply to a message. I don't know if that's, if you've come across that at all before where? On WhatsApp? You cansplit, go back through your message history and choose a specific message to reply to. Um, are you aware of that feature at all?

[00:49:33] **Participant 4:** So not just to current message. You're saying you go back to one a week ago and it, and then send a reply a week later. 

[00:49:40] **Luke:** Yeah, well it'll um, yeah, it's, it's perhaps not the easiest feature to figure out, because I think you have to hold down on the message itself. And then what it'll do is it'll send that person like, so you hold down on it and then click the reply button and type your message in and hit send, and it'll pop up, um, at the very bottom of the chat, like a normal message, but it'll have a little quote with the original message that you're applying to.

[00:50:15] You know, replying to this message 

[00:50:17] **Participant 4:** and that could be handy if you've missed a message, particularly. 

[00:50:20] **Luke:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cause, uh, that's, that's one way where the messages are a bit different to a conversation because sometimes it might be hard to go back to a topic that you covered. 

[00:50:33] **Participant 4:** Yeah. no, definitely that's where it's useful to have things recorded.

[00:50:38] See what- to review what was said. And 

[00:50:41] **Luke:** yeah, 

[00:50:42] **Participant 4:** who said what. 

[00:50:44] **Luke:** Okay, well, um, I think that's pretty much everything, unless there's anything that you can think of. Um, 

[00:50:56] **Participant 4:** Oh, no, that sort of covered everything. I got a few hints on, know what I find useful anyway, how I sort of make use of it. Um, yeah. 

[00:51:10] **Luke:** Yeah. Uh, what, uh, I guess it just occured me, would it be useful if you sent someone a message and you found out then that they were busy, so they wouldn't be able to reply to it for a while? 

[00:51:23] **Participant 4:** Yeah. If it's one where I've felt, it felt like I needed an urgent reply. So for timesensitive ones so that would be helpful.

[00:51:30] **Luke:** Yeah. Cool. Yeah. 

[00:51:34] **Participant 4:** The way you do that, I suppose, is with exclamation marks at the moment. Some sort of alert on that's more emails, that's even just to get a signature or acknowledge receipt, that would be handy. Yeah. Just to let you know how urgent it is. 

[00:51:56] **Luke:** Yeah. Okay. And if that, if that person was blocking notifications, would it be useful to have the option uh, send them a notification anyway. 

[00:52:13] **Participant 4:** Yeah. Yeah. Just to, if they're blocking, if we've got some way of cuing things to say, these people are sending you messages. So when you're unblocking, then see, oh,, these people tried to send me messages. 

[00:52:25] **Luke:** Yeah. 

[00:52:25] **Participant 4:** That would be handy to know. 

[00:52:28] **Luke:** Um, yeah, I guess so do you make use of the do not disturb mode or anything on the phone?

[00:52:37] **Participant 4:** No. Um, 

[00:52:39] **Luke:** I just remembered I haven't,
